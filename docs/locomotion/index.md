## Unified Walking, Running, and Recovery for Humanoids via State-Dependent Adversarial Motion Priors

- **Paper:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.18611)

### Summary

We propose a unified reinforcement learning framework that enables a single policy to perform walking, running, and fall recovery on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, validated on physical hardware without any explicit mode-switching command at deployment. The framework extends Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) by replacing the conventional global reference distribution with a state-dependent gate that routes each training transition to one of two discriminators: a dedicated recovery discriminator and a velocity-conditioned locomotion discriminator that jointly covers walking and running.

## Terrain Consistent Reference-Guided RL for Humanoid Navigation Autonomy

- **Paper:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15517)
- **Authors:** William D. Compton, Zachary Olkin, Aaron D. Ames

### Summary

We present a method for training reference-guided, perceptive reinforcement learning locomotion policies for humanoid robots in which reference trajectories are modulated in training to be consistent with terrain geometry. Aiming to deploy our method with standard navigation autonomy infrastructure, we synthesize SE(2)-controllable reference trajectories inside the RL training loop, projecting desired footsteps onto valid footholds and adjusting swing-foot and center-of-mass trajectories to match the terrain.
